# Sideswipe mod for Voron Switchwire conversion
This mod allows you to use a mechanical switch as a probe on your Switchwire conversion without losing any print volume.
This mod was created remixing two mods:
 • [Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)
 • [SideSwipe](https://github.com/oldfar-t/Side-Swipe-Magnetic-Probe)
